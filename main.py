# The Mini project was Devided into two Parts: Maria is working on the passwrord validation logic and I am working on the user interface.
# The code below is the user interface for the password validation project.
# The code is designed to prompt the user for a password and check if it meets certain criteria.

# Define a list called 'rules' that holds each password requirement, this was provided on the assigment documentation.
# Each rule is represented as a string and we used emojis to make it fun and easy to understand.
rules = [
    "âœ¨ Contains 8â€“16 characters",
    "ðŸ”’ Contains one of the special characters: %$#^&*!@()",
    "ðŸ”¢ Contains at least one number 0â€“9",
    "ðŸ”  Contains at least one capital letter",
    "ðŸ”¤ Starts with a lowercase letter",
    "ðŸš« Does not contain the phrase 'pass'",
    "ðŸš« Does not contain the phrase 'qwerty'",
    "ðŸš« Does not contain the phrase '123'",  
]

#This function prints the list of rules to the screen for the user to see.
#we are using the for loop to go through each rules one at a time and print it.
#We are using \n to create a new line after each rule and \t\t to create a tab space before each rule.

def show_rules():
    print("\nThe password must follow these rules: \n\t\t")
    for rule in rules:
        print(rule)

#This is what the user will see first before entering the password.
show_rules()

#Ask the user to enter a password and store it in the cariable called "password"
password = input("\nPlease enter a password that conforms to the above restrictions:\n\t\t")

#Print the password back to the user so they can see what they entered.
#This is for testing purposes while the logic is being developed. we will replace it with a validation funtion. 
#validate_passord(password)
print(f"Your password is: {password}")


# This is a placegolder for the password validation function.
# This function will be replace once the logic function is deloveloped and the validation function is defined.
# For testing purposes, the function will pretend the password is always valid

def validate_password(password):
    return []

#Use this validation fuction to check if the password meets the requirements.
violations = validate_password(password)

#Password Validation Logic will be  added here
    
#This is to show feedback to the user if the password is valid or not

if violations:
    print("\nThis password does not meet the following requirements:")
    for rule in violations:
        print(f'-{rule}')
else:
    print("\nðŸŽ‰Success! Your Password meets all the requirements.")
