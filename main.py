# The Mini project was Devided into two Parts: Maria is working on the passwrord validation logic and I am working on the user interface.
# The code below is the user interface for the password validation project.
# The code is designed to prompt the user for a password and check if it meets certain criteria.



# Importing the regular expression module to use for pattern matching in password validation.

# Define a list called 'rules' that holds each password requirement, this was provided on the assigment documentation.
# Each rule is represented as a string and we used emojis to make it fun and easy to understand.

    "ðŸ”  Contains at least one capital letter",

#This function prints the list of rules to the screen for the user to see.
